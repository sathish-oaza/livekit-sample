## Deploy LiveKit Server

Install LiveKit Server

```sh
brew update && brew install livekit
```

You can start LiveKit in development mode by running:

```sh
livekit-server --dev
```

This will start an instance using the following API key/secret pair:

```sh
API key: devkey
API secret: secret
```

To customize your setup for production, refer to our deployment guides.


` Tip
` By default LiveKit's signal server binds to 127.0.0.1:7880. If you'd like to access it from other devices on your network, pass in --bind 0.0.0.0
